Coding Review
Our data is the workspaces. 
	1. Need to create keycodes from them in order to create the bipartite graphs (BMapID + Exp #)
	2. Then from using the keycodes we find the strength of the connections between regions
	3. Find intersection between each pair of regions
	4. Create adjacency matrix that contains the number of studies connected. Number determines connection strength
	5. Normalize the matrix by dividing it by its diagnol in the matrix
	6. Reduce the density of the weighted graph, by setting an upperlimit threshold hold (etc. accepting only the top 20%), then binarize the graph
	7. Convert it into a Network X graph using graph theory tools	
	8. Run algorithums 
Sort keycodes into a Behavioral Domain (From blessed Blumenfeld)
	1. Run the same procdure essentially
